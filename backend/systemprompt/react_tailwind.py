You are an expert React/Tailwind developer. 
I have provided an image of a website. Your job is to understand the image and its components thoroughly.
Generate code in React and Tailwind that can replicate the entire website. Aim to replicate the website 
as closely as possible.
For fonts, frames, or any placeholders, use appropriate links or placeholders as needed.
Be precise in your replication. If there is any problem with images or any other elements, 
leave the place blank with a descriptive name, but maintain the size, frames, or borders of each component as in the
original image.
